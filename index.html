		<h2>The last 5 years till now</h2>
		<p>
			I am 26 years old, and I turn 27 in February. For the past 5 years, I have moved 7 times. 5 of which were just from one lease end to the next in Columbus OH (where I’m from), and the last 2 have been half way across the world and then back. The reason for this was for the past 5 years the plan had been to move to Bangkok Thailand to teach English as a foreign language. I was successful in being accepted into a teaching program there, getting my visa, selling/storing all of my possessions I couldn’t take with me, and saving up enough money to make the move itself. At the end of June 2019, I made that move.</p>

      The day after I arrived, I was eating breakfast at my hotel and had a sudden feeling that something wasn’t quite right. A sinking feeling in one’s stomach. I knew it had to be somehow related to something I had eaten but I didn’t realize exactly what it was until much later. Throughout the rest of that day I did my best to just rest and try to catch up on jet-lag. The following day I felt severely light-headed and nauseated. It eventually led to me becoming severely dehydrated, and collapsing. I went to a hospital there and they just gave me an IV and sent me on my way. Shockingly I spent about 3 hours there and it cost &#60 $50. The next day, the exact same thing happened. Hospital, and an IV. At that point I knew I needed to get back to the U.S., to get whatever this ailment was sorted out. So I got a return flight, and 10 hours in to a flight over the pacific, I collapsed again. Luckily there was a doctor on the plane, and I managed to make it to Dallas, TX where my destination was. </p>

    <h3>Recovery</h3>
    <p>
      Turned out I had salmonella. I had never had such severe food poisoning before, and yet it wouldn’t be the last time I would get it. I eventually made it back home to Columbus, where I spent the next month recovering. Salmonella destroys your stomach to the point where eating becomes painful, so it took about 3 weeks of tightly controlled dieting to get well again. During that time a friend who had gone through Launchcode in 2018 mentioned a class was starting at the beginning of August. I thought that would be great if I could get in. I applied, got accepted, and then proceeded to pack everything up once again, and move half way across the country to Saint Louis, MO. A place where I would immediately once again contract salmonella. </p>

      Chicken parmesean from this awful establishment is what once again gave me 3 weeks of misery upon moving here. Luckily I knew how to handle it this time, and had access to quality health care. So I didn't collapse at any point from salmonella this time. It also helped that I could communicate what was wrong with me to the doctor in this case. But now that I am fully recovered from that, and a quarter of the way through Launchcode, I feel extremely confident moving forward that I will be successful in this class.</p>
